                <p>Hello My name is Matthew Cardenas. I am a senior at Anaheim High School. After high school I want to attend a 4 year college and study computer science or software engineering.</p>
                <p>The colleges I would like to attend are UCI because they have good Computer science programs their and they have a really nice campus. I would also like to attend UC santa cruz because they aso have a good comupter scicen program and their campus gives a camping feel with all the red woods their.</p>
                <p>After college I am not sure what I want to do as far as a job. I have thought about making websites, applications, or making video games but I am not certain on excatly what I want to do.</p>
                <P>If I discde to make websites, someone out their will have their own webiste to advertise their porduct or service they provide. If I were to make applications it would be to make a certian thing more efficient to do or finding something more easier. Lastly if I were to make video games I would like to be able to make a story that the palyer can be a part of and gain a life lesson to better help them in life.</P>
